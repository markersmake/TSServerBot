# TSServerBot
This is a bot that users can send messages to in order to play games or play sound bits

## Getting Started
To start, change the USER to whoever the admin is, the PASS to the admin password, the HOST to the server's address, then run the
main_bot_backend_client.py file

## Functions
### main_bot_backend_client.py 
This is a headless bot that will monitor chat for specific commands, then execute a function based on the "!" primer

### flaskTS3Bot.py
This is a flask application that shows anyone connected to the server at time of path connection

#### Notes
For the ts3 python library, add version 2 by cloning the repository on Github.com and running the setup script. Version 1 does not offer as much functionality
